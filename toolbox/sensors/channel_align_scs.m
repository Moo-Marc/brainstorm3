function [Transform, isCancel] = channel_align_scs(ChannelFile, Transform, isWarning, isConfirm)
% CHANNEL_ALIGN_SCS: Saves new MRI anatomical points after manual or auto registration adjustment.
%
% USAGE:  Transform = channel_align_scs(ChannelFile, isWarning=1, isConfirm=1)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%       After modifying registration between digitized head points and MRI (with "refine with head
%       points" or manually), this function allows saving the change in the MRI fiducials so that
%       they exactly match the digitized anatomical points (nasion and ears), instead of saving a
%       registration adjustment transformation for a single functional dataset. This affects all
%       files registered to the MRI and should therefore be done as one of the first steps after
%       importing, and with only one set of digitized points (one session). Surfaces are adjusted to
%       maintain alignment with the MRI. Additional sessions for the same subject, with separate
%       digitized points, will still need the usual "per dataset" registration adjustment to align
%       with the same MRI.
%
%       This function will not modify an MRI that it changed previously without user confirmation
%       (if both isWarning and isConfirm are false). In that case, the Transform is returned unaltered.
%
% INPUTS:
%     - ChannelFile : Channel file to align with its anatomy
%     - Transform   : Transformation matrix from digitized SCS coordinates to MRI SCS coordinates, 
%                     after some alignment is made (auto or manual) and the two no longer match.
%     - isWarning   : If 1, display warning in case of errors, or if this was already done 
%                     previously for this MRI. 
%     - isConfirm   : If 1, ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     - Transform   : If the MRI fiducial points and coordinate system are updated, and the channel 
%                     file is reset, the transform becomes the identity. If the channel file is not
%                     reset, Transform will be the inverse of all previous manual or automatic
%                     adjustments. If the MRI was not updated, the input Transform is returned. The
%                     idea is that the returned Transform applied to the channels would maintain the
%                     registration.
